                    <p>The starting point of this project arrived in conjunction with the process of deciding on future elective courses. We noticed that not only did the Uppsala Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) students feel frustrated with this process; it was a widespread discussion. We soon realized there seemed to be a relevant need to research this issue.</p>
                    <p>In order to give students some freedom to shape their programs, many elective options are introduced in university degrees. Often, these electives have very vague descriptions, and students don’t get to meet the lecturer or alumni who have taken this elective course before the application period ends. Additionally, there are many rules that apply when choosing elective courses - many of them are unclear and unknown.</p>
                    <p>Realizing that every Uppsala student was using the same system, we initially wanted to help all Uppsala students with our design. But after the completion of the first couple of course seminars, while researching to understand the used systems, we recognized that we had to narrow down our focus. Therefore this report only focuses on the research and issues targeted at the HCI program. By doing so, we could access more relevant people and would be able to acquire consistent knowledge about the problems our specific target audience experiences during the process of choosing electives.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Aim of this Project</h2>
                    <p>The aim of our project was to examine if there were any potential improvements to the process of choosing course electives at the Uppsala HCI program. Selecting courses should be easy and efficient so that students should feel satisfied with the process and the program itself. In this report, we will explain our theoretical background, as well as argue for the methodological decisions taken while gathering data and how the data was analyzed. Furthermore, it will be explained how the analyzed data helped us to make informed decisions on how to create our design and how we evaluated the design itself. Finally, we will discuss the pros and cons of our project solution while giving ideas for future improvements.</p>

                    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
                    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quos suscipit facilis ratione voluptas repellat deserunt quod qui voluptate dolorem ipsam necessitatibus vel dolore amet, dolorum nisi voluptates dicta quae blanditiis.</p>
                    <h3>Paradox of Choice</h3>
                    <p>Schwarts (2004) argues that the range of choices people face every day has increased in recent years, which has made it more difficult and demanding to make wise choices. This phenomenon is also present in higher education. He discusses that in the past, universities have had fixed curriculums, and now they offer a wide range of choices of courses, which becomes a cause for negative feelings such as regret, fear of missed opportunities, and raised expectations. The author compares choosing elective courses nowadays to a shopping experience. This is a metaphor that was made use of in the design phase of this project by mimicking an online shopping experience and the various features associated with it.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the author's biggest concern about "shopping for knowledge" is that students often do not have all the resources they need in order to make wise choices. With our final solution, we aim to solve the issue by providing all necessary information to students in one single platform or suggesting possible ways of obtaining this information.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, the author identifies two types of people based on how they make choices- maximizers and satisficers. Maximizers want to make the best choices possible and carefully examine all options while satisficers look for the options that are just good enough. This is highly relevant to our research as students can also be split into these two categories. This became apparent during the data gathering phase, and later on, we created two different personas of students- a maximizer and a satisficer. We made sure to address the needs of both personas in our design solution.</p>
                    <h3>Evaluation of selection criteria</h3>
                    <p>Several other articles about academic decision-making were studied to inform our research methodology design. Relevant survey and interview questions and popular course selection criteria were extracted. Questions from the following categories: Future Importance, Difficulty/Negativity, Decision Process Description, Certainty/Comfort, and Independence (Galotti, Tandler, & Wiener, 2014) were considered relevant for our study and were used directly or were paraphrased to fit the needs of our research. They helped us get valuable insights into the decision-making patterns of HCI students.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we got informed about the most preferred course selection criteria from two papers that studied a wide range of initial criteria. Ting, D. H., & Lee, C. K. C. (2012) found that the most important variables that influence the students’ selection of electives are the perceived difficulty of the course, perceived interest in the subject, and relevancy for the student’s future career. Another paper’s results indicate that the top three factors influencing the decisions are: course hours, the usefulness of the course in a real working environment, and connection with the lecturer (Koksalmis, 2019). All these criteria were considered relevant for our data gathering phase. We used them in our research by including them in the survey and interview questions. Furthermore, they were taken into account while designing the requirements for the final design solution.</p>

                    <h2>Data Gathering & Analysis</h2>
                    <h3 class="mb-3">Methodology</h3>
                    <h4>Survey</h4>
                    <p>A survey was conducted to collect quantitative data on students' experience selecting elective courses. We have surveyed first-years, second-years, and alumni of the HCI program at Uppsala University. The results were used to validate data obtained in other research activities; these activities are discussed in subsequent sections of this paper.</p>
                    <p>To do the survey, we first created the questions and the survey via Google Forms. Once the survey was designed, we shared it in several HCI social media groups and reached out to some potential candidates individually (primarily second-year students and alumni). Each participant was first asked to read and sign a consent form. The form explained the purpose of the study, what the data is used for, and that they may withdraw at any given time and have their data removed per GDPR Article 17 law of erasure (Regulation 2016/679).</p>
                    <h4>Interviews</h4>
                    <p>We conducted interviews with the program coordinator of the HCI program and a course administrator at Uppsala University to also understand their perspective on the topic. The goal was to find out why the current process exists, how the process works, and what are some common questions students ask during the course selection process.</p>
                    <p>The interviews were conducted either online or in person. An interviewer and observer were present during the interviews. All sessions were recorded to be used for transcribing and analysis in a later stage. Consent for participating in the interviews was obtained prior to every interview.</p>
                    <h4>Focus Groups</h4>
                    <p>To understand the students' perspective, we conducted two focus group interviews, each with five to seven participants, a facilitator, and an observer. The first focus group was conducted with first-year HCI master's students to learn about their experience of choosing electives for the first time at Uppsala University. We also conducted a focus group with experienced elective courses applicants (second-year students and alumni) to know about their experience with the process, selection strategy, criteria, and information gathering methods.</p>
                    <p>Conducting focus groups gave us a clear picture of what problems the students are facing with the current process, where they struggle, and what help they expect to receive during selecting electing courses. The session was recorded to be used for transcribing and analysis in a later stage. Like the interviews and surveys, each participant signed a consent form before the interviews.</p>
                    <h4>Thematic Analysis</h4>
                    <p>Once the data-gathering phase was completed, we started analyzing the data obtained from the interviews with the university staff and the focus groups with students. We also included the answers to the open-ended questions from the survey in the data set. We chose inductive thematic analysis as our method for analyzing the qualitative data. We transcribed the recordings and tagged them with appropriate codes. These codes helped us discover different themes (trends or patterns) in the data. We distributed all the codes in the appropriate themes. We re-iterated the same process in order to refine the themes.</p>
                    <p>We used the application <a class="link" href="https://consider.ly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consider.ly</a> to perform thematic analysis. It also provided additional insights that helped us understand where the issues lie by showing us various comparisons and visualizations. The interviews and focus groups were analyzed separately as the context is different in each case. The subsequent section outlines the themes generated from analyzing the qualitative data of students and staff.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-3">Results</h3>
                    <h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>
                    <p>The majority (42.9%) of students indicated that they tend to think about electives for at least a couple of days, and around 30% think about it a lot. This is two-thirds of all students.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, students do not think that they are getting enough information (Appendix C.4). The majority of them evaluated two out five (one being the worst) the way they are informed. Along with this result, we saw that a great number of students are very likely to look for extra information when they choose electives. Combining these results, we found that if students do not feel informed, they tend to look for additional information. Therefore we can argue that there is a clear need for a tool that helps them to be informed properly. Appendix C.5 shows that most students tend to collect more information by talking to classmates and browsing the Uppsala University website.</p>
                    <p>The survey results also showed us that fee-paying students are more likely to worry about not making the best choices compared to the non-fee-paying students. Moreover, non-fee paying students are more independent when it comes to choosing courses compared to fee-paying students. Lastly, do students think that they have enough choice? All students feel that there are not enough choices to choose from. In fact, nobody feels totally satisfied with the number of choices. This result is contradictory because, in Sweden, students can apply to courses from all universities in the country. Therefore, it is likely that people do not know the number of choices they have (Appendix C.3). Lastly, the answers to the criteria related questions (Appendix C.3) indicate students are likely to choose courses that help towards future career goals and their relevance in the working field are most important, next to their interest in the subject. The results, on the other hand, also show that difficulty and the connection with the lecturer are less important for all students.</p>
                    <p>After the data-gathering phase, we concluded that when moving on, some information from the quantitative analysis was less helpful for us than the results of the other activities we had done. The most valuable aspects we considered were the differences between the answers of fee-paying and non-fee-paying students on the semantic differential questions on information, feelings, and criteria. We used these to compare and validate the results of focus group and thematic analysis.</p>
                    <h4>Thematic Analysis</h4>
                    <p>Our thematic analysis ended up giving us four themes from the university staff interviews and seven themes from student focus groups and qualitative sections of survey questions.</p>
                    <p>The university staff transcriptions led us to make clusters of codes, into these specific themes: “Master program design” (1), “Approach to informing students” (2), “Common issues for students” (3), and “Systems used, procedures in place and useful, practical information” (4) (see Appendix A.1). The two most important themes for us were theme (2) and (3), which included many popular tags that we decided to focus further on in making our design requirements. Examples of this are the tag “Fee-paying student problems” (theme 3) that were mentioned five times in total from our interviews, or “informing students on application process” (theme 2). With such insights, we knew we had to think hard about how to improve the fee-paying students' experience in the application process.</p>
                    <p>The specific themes from the students were: “Issues: Lack of info” (A), “Issues: Course planning” (B), “Issues: Master program rules and design” (C), “Advantages: Students Perspective (D), “Course selection strategy and criteria” (E), “Suggested Ideas” (F), and “Feelings and Emotions while choosing courses” (G) (see Appendix A.2). Theme (A), (C), and (E) ended up being the most important themes to focus on, counting the amount certain code tags were mentioned in every theme group. The tag “unclear rules” (C) was the most popular tag, coded 21 times, which meant that we as designers would have to create an application where the rules of the elective process should be visible and easy to find. Similarly, “senior to junior student interaction” (E) and “choosing based on career goals” (E) tags inspired us to design user incentives in our design.</p>
                    <h3>Post Analysis</h3>
                    <h4>Personas</h4>
                    <p>After the thematic analysis was done, we used the acquired themes to build five personas (Appendix E). The personas represented the different types of users that took part in our survey, interviews, and focus groups. Their different characteristics, goals, frustrations, and other individual attributes placed the participants into three student personas and two university staff personas. These personas guided the generation of requirements needed for our ideation process, which in turn led to wireframing. Through the use of personas, we could better understand the needs of our users and became a tool of reference to constantly refer back to throughout our later stages of this project (Benyon, 2013).</p>
                    <h4>Requirements elicitation and prioritization</h4>
                    <p>Like previously mentioned, with personas completed, the next step was to use them to generate requirements. The MoSCoW framework was used to prioritize the requirements. All requirements are listed in Appendix F.</p>
